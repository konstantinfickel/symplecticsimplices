\section*{Abstract}
This bachelor thesis shows that two 2n-simplices \( \Delta, \Delta' \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n} \) are equal up affine symplectomorphism if and only if the symplectic areas of their 2-dimensional subsimplices coincide. This is a generalization of \cite{cieliebak} which gave this result for \( n = 2 \).
