# Symplectic classification of simplices

My bachelor thesis in mathematics supervised by [professor Cieliebak](https://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/prof/geo/mitarbeiter/cieliebak/) at the University of Augsburg.

## Abstract

This bachelor thesis shows that two 2n-simplices Δ, Δ' are equal up affine symplectomorphism if and only if the symplectic areas of their 2-dimensional subsimplices coincide. This is a generalization of [CH14] which gave this result for n = 2.
